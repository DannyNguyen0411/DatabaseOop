# Project9
My Project partners: Zeno Stadhouders & Sten Nierop

<b>What I've done on this project:</b>
<br />
Register<br />
Security token (csrf token) for the login.<br />
Make the loginpage more secure<br />
If the user is logged in, the user has their own navbar so the user can see his/her name<br />
Userprofile update<br />
Categorize the products<br />
Searchbar for the products<br />
<br />

One of my project partners works with the handlers. So I also applied to work with the handlers.
